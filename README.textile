h2. Summary

A user-friendly superset of the S3 gem geared towards file system backup operations.

h2. Description

Smooth S3 is a user-friendly superset of the S3 gem geared towards file system backup operations. It greatly simplifies regular file uploads to S3 by using Convention over Configuration™. The library also adds new features such as directory syncronization and timestamped uploads, which should come in real handy to anyone doing backup scripts on a regular basis. A decent amount of control is left to the developer: You can specify a prefix path to use with any upload and provide your own timestamp formats if desired.

The goal with Smooth S3 is to facilitate and simplify your S3 uploads. It is a library focused on the file system, so no integration with MySQL, third-party services or anything like that. Nothing prevents you from doing a _mysqldump_ and uploading the results in the same script using Smooth S3 though ;)

h2. Installation

This library has been developed against and designed for MRI 1.9.2 in a UNIX environment. It should be compatible with 1.8.6+, as well as with other Ruby implementations, but no guarantees. Probably not compatible with Windows environments.

<pre>
Using RubyGems - _gem install smooth\_s3_
Using Bundler - _gem "smooth\_s3"_ in Gemfile, then _bundle install_
</pre>

h2. Overview

Before running upload operations using Smooth S3, you will need to initialize the service using your AWS credentials.

Once that is done you can use the following methods:

* _upload()_ - Regular file upload. Can specify multiple files at once. Directory structure is not preserved, only the file name.

* _sync\_directory()_ - Uploads the entire content of a directory and its subdirectories. Preserves folder directory structure inside S3.
 
* _timestamped\_upload()_ - Like a regular upload. Files uploaded this way have a timestamp added in front of their names. Default timestamp format: YYYYmmddHHMMSS  

* _timestamped\_directory\_sync()_ Like a regular directory sync. Provided directory has a timestamp added in front of its name. Default timestamp format: YYYYmmddHHMMS

Each of the 4 methods above also has a bang(!) version available. The difference between the regular and bang version is that the former won't overwrite existing files in the selected bucket, while the latter will.

You can also specify a prefix as an option to the above methods. This will be inserted in front of what would have been the normal path on S3. For example, you upload _'test.rb'_ with the prefix _'path/to'_. It will show up on S3 as _'path/to/test.rb'_

That's it! Code examples in the next section.

h2. How to use

<pre>
require 'rubygems' # if using 1.8
require 'smooth_s3'

# Initialize the service
# Params: :aws_key, :aws_secret(, :ssl => false)
 
@service = SmoothS3::Service.new(:aws_key => "MY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY", :aws_secret => "MY_AWS_SECRET_KEY")


# upload()
# Params: bucket_name, files(, :prefix)

@service.upload("my_test_bucket", "test.rb")
@service.upload!("my_test_bucket", ["here.rb", "../parent.rb"], :prefix => "prefix/to/files")


# sync_directory()
# Params: bucket_name, directory(, :prefix)

@service.sync_directory("my_test_bucket", "../reports")
@service.sync_directory!("my_test_bucket", "data", :prefix => "prefix/to/dir")


# timestamped_upload()
# Params: bucket_name, files(, :prefix, :timestamp_type => :epoch/:strftime(default), :timestamp_format => "%Y%m%d%H%M%S" )

@service.timestamped_upload("my_test_bucket", "test.rb")
@service.timestamped_upload!("my_test_bucket", "test.rb", :timestamp_type => :epoch)
@service.timestamped_upload!("my_test_bucket", "test.rb", :timestamp_type => :strftime, :timestamp_format => "%Y%m%d")


# timestamped_directory_sync()
# Params: bucket_name, directory(, :prefix, :timestamp_type => :epoch/:strftime(default), :timestamp_format => "%Y%m%d%H%M%S" )

@service.timestamped_directory_sync("my_test_bucket", "data")
@service.timestamped_directory_sync!("my_test_bucket", "data", :timestamp_type => :epoch)
@service.timestamped_directory_sync!("my_test_bucket", "data", :timestamp_type => :strftime, :timestamp_format => "%Y%m%d")
</pre>
