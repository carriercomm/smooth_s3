### 0.2.1 ###
  - Added :only and :except options to the 2 directory_sync methods. You can pass a Regexp or an array of Regexps.

### 0.2.0 ###
  - Refactoring run
  - Connection errors and failed uploads are now all properly rescued by appropriate logic.
  - Uploads will now be tried up to 3 times before moving on to the next file.
  - Caching service buckets when initializing, saving tons of requests. This speeds up directory sync operations a lot.
  - Renamed sync_directory(!) to directory_sync(!) for consistency. Old method names are aliased for backward compatibility.

### 0.1.0 ###
